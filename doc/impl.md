# Skylark in Go: Implementation

This document describes some of the design choices of the Go
implementation of Skylark.

[TOC]

## Scanner

The scanner is derived from Russ Cox's
[buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildifier)
tool, which pretty-prints Bazel BUILD files.

Most of the work happens in `(*scanner).nextToken`.

## Parser

The parser is hand-written recursive-descent parser. It uses the
technique of [precedence
climbing](http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm#climbing)
to reduce the number of productions.

Because `load` is not a reserved word, Skylark's `load` statements are
created by post-processing `load(...)` function calls that appear in
an expression statement.

In some places the parser accepts a larger set of programs than are
strictly valid, leaving the task of rejecting them to the subsequent
resolver pass. For example, in the function call `f(a, b=c)` the
parser accepts any expression for `a` and `b`, even though `b` may
legally be only an identifier. For the parser to distinguish these
cases would require additional lookahead.

## Resolver

The resolver reports structural errors in the program, such as the use
of `break` and `continue` outside of a loop.

Skylark has stricter syntactic limitations than Python. For example,
it does not permit `for` loops or `if` statements at top level, nor
does it permit global variables to be bound more than once.
These limitations come from the Bazel project's desire to make it easy
to identify the sole statement that defines each global, permitting
accurate cross-reference documentation.

In addition, the resolver validates all variable names, classifying
them as references to builtin, global, local, or free variables.
Local and free variables are mapped to a small integer, allowing the
evaluator to use an efficient (flat) representation for the
environment.

Not all features of the Go implementation are "standard" (that is,
supported by Bazel's Java implementation), at least for now, so
non-standard features such as `lambda`, `float`, and `set`
are flag-controlled.  The resolver reports
any uses of dialect features that have not been enabled.


## Evaluator

### Data types

<b>Integers:</b> Integers are representing using `big.Int`, an
arbitrary precision integer. This representation was chosen because,
for many applications, Skylark must be able to handle without loss
protocol buffer values containing signed and unsigned 64-bit integers,
which requires 65 bits of precision.

Small integers (<256) are preallocated, but all other values require
memory allocation. Integer performance is relatively poor, but it
matters little for Bazel-like workloads which depend much
more on lists of strings than on integers. (Recall that a typical loop
over a list in Skylark does not materialize the loop index as an `int`.)

An optimization worth trying would be to represent integers using
either an `int32` or `big.Int`, with the `big.Int` used only when
`int32` does not suffice. Using `int32`, not `int64`, for "small"
numbers would make it easier to detect overflow from operations like
`int32 * int32`, which would trigger the use of `big.Int`.

<b>Floating point</b>:
Floating point numbers are represented using Go's `float64`.
Again, `float` support is required to support protocol buffers. The
existence of floating-point NaN and its infamous comparison behavior
(`NaN != NaN`) had many ramifications for the API, since we cannot
assume the result of an ordered comparison is either less than,
greater than, or equal: it may also fail.

<b>Strings</b>:

TODO: discuss UTF-8 and string.bytes method.

<b>Dictionaries and sets</b>:
Skylark dictionaries have predictable iteration order.
Furthermore, many Skylark values are hashable in Skylark even though
the Go values that represent them are not hashable in Go: big
integers, for example.
Consequently, we cannot use Go maps to implement Skylark's dictionary.

We use a simple hash table whose buckets are linked lists, each
element of which holds up to 8 key/value pairs. In a well-distributed
table the list should rarely exceed length 1. In addition, each
key/value item is part of doubly-linked list that maintains the
insertion order of the elements for iteration.

<b>Evaluation strategy:</b>
The evaluator uses a simple recursive tree walk, returning a value or
an error for each expression. We have experimented with just-in-time
compilation of syntax trees to bytecode, but two limitations in the
current Go compiler prevent this strategy from outperforming the
tree-walking evaluator.

First, the Go compiler does not generate a "computed goto" for a
switch statement ([Go issue
5496](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5496)). A bytecode
interpreter's main loop is a for-loop around a switch statement with
dozens or hundreds of cases, and the speed with which each case can be
dispatched strongly affects overall performance.
Currently, a switch statement generates a binary tree of ordered
comparisons, requiring several branches instead of one.

Second, the Go compiler's escape analysis assumes that the underlying
array from a `make([]Value, n)` allocation always escapes
([Go issue 20533](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20533)).
Because the bytecode interpreter's operand stack has a non-constant
length, it must be allocated with `make`. The resulting allocation
adds to the cost of each Skylark function call; this can be tolerated
by amortizing one very large stack allocation across many calls.
More problematic appears to be the cost of the additional GC write
barriers incurred by every VM operation: every intermediate result is
saved to the VM's operand stack, which is on the heap.
By contrast, intermediate results in the tree-walking evaluator are
never stored to the heap.
